# Honeypot
The honeypot service exposes multiple services, defined in `config.json`, using the Python library [honeypots](https://pypi.org/project/honeypots/). The logs generated by the various honeypots are sent to Wazuh via Syslog.

## Notes
We do not install the honeypots library directly from PyPI in order to apply a patch [`syslog_valid_json.patch`](syslog_valid_json.patch) to the code. This is because the Syslog messages generated by the honeypot contain invalid JSON (strings delimited by single quotes instead of double quotes). The patch we apply fixes this issue, making the logs easier to parse by Wazuh.
